## 🎨 Logo Design Philosophy

### Core Concept: **Digital Circuit Shield + AI Neural Network**

The AdRig logo represents the fusion of **advanced artificial intelligence** and **military-grade security** through:

1. **Modern Shield Architecture** - Sophisticated curved design, not basic geometry
2. **Circuit Board Pattern** - Real-world PCB-style traces showing active technology
3. **AI Neural Network** - Interconnected nodes representing machine learning
4. **Security Lock Icon** - Central padlock symbolizing protection
5. **Cyber-Tech Gradient** - Deep ocean blue to electric cyan (professional, not playful)
6. **Glowing Effects** - Premium outer glow suggesting active protection

### Visual Identity

```
🔷 SHIELD DESIGN
   └─ Modern curved shield (not hexagon - too basic)
   └─ Pointed bottom for dynamic protection stance
   └─ Smooth curves for premium brand perception

🔷 CIRCUIT PATTERN
   └─ Horizontal & vertical traces like real PCB
   └─ Node intersections showing connectivity
   └─ Cyan glow representing electrical current

🔷 NEURAL NETWORK
   └─ 7 interconnected AI nodes
   └─ Multiple connection layers
   └─ Glowing nodes showing active intelligence

🔷 LOCK ICON
   └─ Central security symbol
   └─ Gradient fill (cyan to blue)
   └─ Keyhole detail for authenticity
